    "Heart disease can refer to a wide range of diseases/pathologies, but in this case refers to coronary artery disease which involves reduction of blood flow to the heart due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaque can build up in the arteries, and if near the heart can lead to the development of heart disease.\r\n",

Generally, men develop heart disease at a younger age than women and have a higher risk than women. One of the reasons for this is that women are somewhat protected by estrogen and progesterone in their early stages of life (until menopause). These hormones, in addition to being responsible for reproduction, also boost blood vessel health."
