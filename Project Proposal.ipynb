Generally, men develop heart disease at a younger age than women and have a higher risk than women. One of the reasons for this is that women are somewhat protected by estrogen and progesterone which boost blood vessel health. In this dataset 0 = Female, 1 = Male.\n",

    "These visualizations show a couple of interesting trends, first of all that we don't really have patients at the extremes of the age spectrum. This makes sense in the context of healthcare, but in the data we do see the proportion of younger people 25-55 with more severe diagnoses, i.e. 2 or 3 is much lower than those 55 and up.\n",

The 160-180 group is dominated by a null diagnosis, 140-160 has at least a majority being heart disease free, but as we go lower the prevalence of heart disease becomes the norm, not the exception."
