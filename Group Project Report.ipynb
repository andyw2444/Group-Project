    "Heart disease can refer to a wide range of diseases, but in this case refers to coronary artery disease which involves reduction of blood flow to the heart due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaque can build up in the arteries, and if near the heart can lead to heart attacks and other complications. The causes of this plaque build up aren’t exactly clear, but gradually builds up accompanied by inflammation of the arterial walls, reducing blood flow (John Hopkins Medicine, 2021). \r\n",

    "It has 14 usable attributes, half of which are integer variables and the other half are categorical. Our project revolves around answering the question, **what factors contributes to heart disease?**\r\n",

    "Heart disease is of growing concern, especially as humans continue to grow older and has become the leading factor of death for humans around the world accounting for 16% of total deaths globally (WHO’s Global Health Estimates, 2020). It also disproportionately affects wealthier nations and more importantly in this investigation has correlations with many health metrics and biological markers (WHO’s Global Health Estimates, 2020). \r\n"
